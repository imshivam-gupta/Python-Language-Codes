# Take the principal amount, rate of interest, and the time period as input and calculate the Simple Interest.
# Note: Return answer as Floor value.
# Input Format:
# The first line of input contains a single integer Principal amount. 
# The Second line of input contains a single decimal Rate of interest.
# The Third line of input contains a single Integer Time period.
# Output Format:
# Calculate the Simple Interest and print it.
# Sample Input 1:
# 2000
# 2.2
# 4
# Sample Output 1:
# 176
# Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
# The input is principal=2000, rate=2.2 and time=4.
# So Simple interest=Principal*rate*time/100 hence 
# answer is 2000*2.2*4/100=176

#Your code goes here
a=float(input())
b=float(input())
c=float(input())
d=(a*b*c)/100
print(int(d))
