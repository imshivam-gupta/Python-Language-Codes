# Take the length(L) and breadth(B) of the rectangle as input and find its area.
# Note:
# Length and breadth must be an integer value and the area will always be in the range of integers.
# Input Format:
# The first line of input contains two integers, both separated by a single space denoting the length and breadth respectively.
# Output Format:
# The only line of output prints the area of the rectangle
# Constraints:
# 1 <= L, B <= 10ˆ2
# Sample Input 1:
# 4 20
# Sample Output 1:
# 80
# Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
# Length of the rectangle is 4 and breadth is 20. 
# Hence the area of the rectangle is (length*breadth). 
# So the answer is 4*20=80.



x, y = map(int, input().split())
print(x*y)
